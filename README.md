A very simple app that helps you become aware of your unwanted thought patterns, and aids you in reconstructing your thought-life.


# Usage

[(Back to top)](#rumination-vanquished)

Rumination Vanquished allows the user to track unwanted thought patters and automatically generates suggestions of counterfactual thoughts (via GPT) to reduce rumination.  The tracking of the frequency of each thought and the effectiveness of each counter-thought builds awareness and low-layer agency over what the user regularly focuses on.
